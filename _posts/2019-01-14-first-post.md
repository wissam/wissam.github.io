title: Re:Learning
---

It is been years since I have been working as a Build/DevOps/CloudInfrastructure Engineer.

It works well with my personality:
- I am pretty meticulous
- I spot patterns very easily
- I am able to optimise paths very well

But this made me be stuck in ready made systems, with ready made DSLs, and
limited fun!

Thus this blog...

I want to enjoy tech again. I need to create something new. 

My goal is to learn and have fun with:

- NodeJS
- GoLang
- Vue.JS
- Arduino 
- 3D Printing
- Misc fun :)
